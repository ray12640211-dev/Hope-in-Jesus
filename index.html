        Salvation is the free gift of God through Jesus Christ —
        not works, not religion, not self-improvement.

            <h2>How to Be Saved</h2>
            <p class="muted">What the Bible says (Romans Road):</p>

            <blockquote>
              “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”
              <br>— Romans 3:23
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners,
              Christ died for us.”
              <br>— Romans 5:8
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
              <br>— Romans 6:23
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              “If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead,
              you will be saved.”
              <br>— Romans 10:9
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              “For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”
              <br>— Romans 10:13

            </p>

            <textarea id="salvationPrayer" aria-label="Salvation prayer">
Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner.
I believe You died for my sins and rose again.
I turn from my sin and place my trust in You alone.
Please forgive me, save me by Your grace,
and give me eternal life.
I receive You as my Lord and Savior.
In Jesus’ name, amen.
